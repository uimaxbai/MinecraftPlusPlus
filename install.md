# How to install Minecraft++

Minecraft++ is a Forge mod, which means you have to install it.

If you have Forge already for <b>1.18.2</b> then you can skip this step.

  Pre-cautionary step: make sure you have run 1.18.2 before in the <b>official launcher</b> and that you have downloaded the official launcher in the first place if you haven't, download it from https://minecraft.net/download.
1. Download the correct version of Forge from here https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.18.2.html
2. Save to an appropriate location
3. Double-click it
4. <i>For Mac users only: if you open it and it shows up like the image below, go to System Preferences (or Settings in Ventura)/Privacy and Security and click 'Allow' next to 'Application was blocked'.</i>

5. Click 'Install' if you are on the normal Minecraft launcher.
6. If not, read the seperate documentation for your launcher.
7. Forge should be installed!
8. Final step: make sure you run the modded version of Minecraft before you move on.

Installing the mod:
1. Copy the `plusplus*.*.*-*.**.*.jar` file to your .minecraft folder.
2. For the official Minecraft launcher and many others it is:
  Windows: Open up File Explorer, double-click on the bar on the top that shows your path, then type in
  `%APPDATA%\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`. Paste the file into here.
  Mac: Open a Finder window, press Cmd+Shift+G. Paste in `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods`.
  Linux (mainly on Ubuntu): If you used `snap install` to install Minecraft then you should paste it at at `~/snap/minecraft-launcher-ot/67/.minecraft\mods`.

Relaunch Minecraft, and you're good to go!
