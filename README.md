<i>A WIP Minecraft Mod that adds enchantments, items and more! (mainly for me to test mcreator out tho)</i>

### Things that are in the mod:
- `Smelting Touch` enchantment - copied directly from Hypixel Skyblock and does what you think it does
- **Hammers** - cool for mining and attacking

Planning to support this mod for a long time!

Support:
Currently only 1.18.2 is supported in singleplayer, but I am wanting to port it to 1.19.2 too.
Versions earlier will not be supported due to the use of netherite.

## That's all for now!
